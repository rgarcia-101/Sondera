### The Problem of Organization:

No matter who you are, chances are you have found yourself, at one point or another, losing track of things. Losing where something is, forgetting a piece of information you needed, or having a date slip from your mind, it is all too common for us to become disorganized with our things. While there already exists many different ways of keeping your data organized while on the web, sometimes it can feel decentralized. Bookmarks here, saved dates there, you may end up getting disorganized with the very things that are meant to be the organizers. My idea is for an easy and convenient place to jot things down and access them again later. With this, you can take notes, store bookmarks, save dates, and have a board to plan your to-do list, with more features planned in the future such as file storage and sharing with other users.
